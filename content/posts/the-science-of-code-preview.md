We are preparing the upcoming release of The Science of Code v2, a brand new version of our open source community.

The Science of Code is a web where people can share knowledge about computing. For free and without any kind of censorship.

We've decided to remove all ads and any tracking system, so the new web will be 100% privacy focused. The new version will be available on English and Spanish since day 1.

While we finish it, you can check the old version (only available on Spanish):

Keep coding!
