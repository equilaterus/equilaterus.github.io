We have released version 1.0.2 of our Utility AI configurator for Unreal Engine. It's completely free and open source. It was created on ElectronJS so it runs on Linux, Windows and Mac. We provide the binaries for Windows but you can compile it for other systems.

To start using it, just go to the repository:
