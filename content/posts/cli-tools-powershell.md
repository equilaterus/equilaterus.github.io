We have released a new solution to make easier than ever writing Powershell utilities. Say hello to effortless Powershell Scripting!

* Automatically handles the start location path avoiding errors when the script is located on subfolders or when it's called from different paths.

* By default errors do not close command line windows, so you can display better feedback to your users.

* Great to write CLI utils for your projects without needing to write additional code.

* One script to rule them all: Powershell is Multiplatform!
