## Quick start (Linux)

1. If you don't have a compatible version installed in your system (or if you find any problems trying to execute the project), download [hugo binaries](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.117.0) and extract them inside the project folder. You should see a single file called **hugo** in your project root folder, rename it to *.hugo*.

2. Install **node** and run the following commands:

   ```sh
   npm install
   
   # Using a globally installed hugo
   npm run start

   # Using a local bin
   npm run hugo-local
   ```
