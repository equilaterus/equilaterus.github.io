## Before start

You are welcome to contribute to any project and we'll really appreciate your help, but before you start please take this into account:

* This is an open-source community no one will ever going to tell you what to do. Be disciplined.
* You came here to propose, to argue and to build something that makes the difference. Be open minded.
* Creating good things take time and even more for projects where most of the team is working on their free time by passion. Be patient.
* You are not alone, we are a community that wants to help you. Do not be shy and do not be worried about failing.
